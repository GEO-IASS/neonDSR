Atmosphereic characterization during the pathfinder mission relied on 
measurements of a CIMEL sun photometer that is a member of the Aerosol
Robotic Network (AERONET).  The measurements were uploaded to and 
processed by AERONET.  Spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) are reported
in these files.

More information of on AOD can be found on the AERONET/NASA website:
