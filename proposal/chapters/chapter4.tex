\chapter{Big Data Techniques}

In this chapter we introduce the tools that we will be using to accomplish the proposal.

\section{Markov Logic Networks}
as first order logic software systems become intractable with not so large set of rules and without even probabilities mln adds probabilities and uses mcmc to tackle scalability.
\section{Deep Learning}
use large amounts of data at hand.
